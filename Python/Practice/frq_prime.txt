A range [L..H] is called a K-Frequent Prime range if there are atleast K primes amongst the numbers L,L+1,..,H. Given N and K, calculate how many subranges of the range [2 ..N] are K-Frequent Prime.


Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains 2 integers N and K.


Output

Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case, containing the required answer.

Example


Sample Input:
4
2 1
5 2
5 1
9 3

Sample Output:
1
4
9
8

Note: For the first test case, the only valid subrange is [2..2], whereas for the second test case, the valid subranges are : [2..3],[2..4],[2..5],[3..5].

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

2 <= N <= 100000

0 <= K <= 10000
